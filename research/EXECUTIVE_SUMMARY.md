2. **First-person affirmations 2x more powerful** than second-person (ages 2+)
3. **Rhyming is THE best predictor** of early literacy success
4. **15 months of music training** shows measurable brain structure changes
5. **Babies respond to lullabies across all cultures** (universal elements)

### Most Actionable Insights:
1. **60-80 BPM = calming** (matches heartbeat) → Use for all lullabies
2. **Repetition ratios decrease with age** → Specific percentages by age
3. **D4-D5 vocal range** → Hard constraint for all melodies
4. **Attention span = age × 3-5 minutes** → Song length guideline
5. **Cultural representation shapes identity ages 3-5** → Diversity critical

### Most Important Takeaways:
1. **Music is brain-building technology**, not just entertainment
2. **85% of brain develops by age 5** → Early music exposure critical
3. **Active music-making > passive listening** → Engagement essential
4. **Age-appropriateness is non-negotiable** → Can't skip developmental stages
5. **Quality matters more than quantity** → One great song > 10 mediocre ones
