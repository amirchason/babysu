## Core Principles

### 1. Developmentally Appropriate Practice (DAP)
**Source**: National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC)

**Key Tenets**:
- Match content to child's current developmental stage
- Provide just-right challenge (neither too easy nor too hard)
- Respect individual differences in development pace
- Build on what child already knows

**Application to Music**:
- Age-specific vocabulary levels
- Appropriate attention span (song length)
- Suitable cognitive complexity
- Motor skills matching movement requirements

### 2. Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
**Source**: CAST (Center for Applied Special Technology)

**Three Principles**:
1. **Multiple means of representation**: Visual + auditory + kinesthetic
2. **Multiple means of engagement**: Choice, relevance, challenge level
3. **Multiple means of expression**: Singing, moving, playing, creating

**Application to Music**:
- Songs that can be experienced through listening, singing, moving
- Adaptable for different ability levels
- Engagement through multiple modalities
- Options for participation (loud/quiet singing, big/small movements)

### 3. The Mother-Tongue Approach
**Source**: Suzuki, Kodály, Gordon

**Principles**:
- Immersion and environmental learning
- Listening before performing
- Repetition as natural learning
- Parent/caregiver involvement
- Small steps building to mastery

**Application to Music**:
- Songs designed for repeated listening
- Simple beginning, gradual complexity
- Family-friendly, singable melodies
- Incremental skill building

### 4. Culturally Responsive Practice
**Source**: Geneva Gay, Zaretta Hammond

**Principles**:
- Validate diverse cultural experiences
- Use culturally relevant references
- Respect multiple perspectives
- Build cultural competence

**Application to Music**:
- Diverse musical styles and influences
- Inclusive lyrics (names, family structures, celebrations)
- Multiple language elements
- Representation in content

- Avoid emphasis above 10 kHz for young children
- Don't remove low frequencies entirely (warmth and fullness)

### Content Safety

**Emotional Safety**:
- No scary or anxiety-inducing content
